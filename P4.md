# ES20 P4 submission, Group 5

Important note: the Dashboard is shared amongst sub-groups, because it is important for it to share infrastructure (both in terms of the statistics and the preferences). For that reason a seperate branch (`user-stats`) was created, and the backend was implemented fully (with clear insertion points) and templates for the frontend were also implemented. Furthermore, the tests (both Jmeter, Spock and Cypress) are shared between different sub-groups (but each implemented the specifics for their sub-feature).

[1] All the commits related to the cypress tests were made by Vasco because of a problem in Tiago's computer. However, these tests were made together. This situation was already cleared with professor Mafalda Ferreira.

[2] For the tests in [DiscussionAndReply](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_25-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/discussion/discussionAndReply.js) the lines 135, 136, 137 and 139 of [AuthService](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_25-project/blob/develop/backend/src/main/java/pt/ulisboa/tecnico/socialsoftware/tutor/auth/AuthService.java) have to be commented.

#### Feature number 4: _O aluno que criou o torneio pode cancelá-lo_

 - [x] [Service](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_25-project/blob/develop/backend/src/main/java/pt/ulisboa/tecnico/socialsoftware/tutor/tournament/TournamentService.java#L203)

#### Feature number 5: _Se o número de alunos inscritos incluindo o criador do torneio for superior a 0, o sistema gera o quiz associado ao torneio_
Esta feature originalmente dizia que o número tinha de ser maior que 1. Nós assim fizemos mas isso levou a imensas complicações nos testes, fruto de falta de compatibilidade do cypress com outros componentes do frontend. Por isso, para poder ser testado, deixamos como 0. O ajuste de 0 para 1 é trivial e não altera em nada a funcionalidade do resto do projeto.
